Mobile MyBB 1.8 Premium (MMyBB18P) is a mobile-friendly, Accelerated Mobile Pages complied MyBB 1.8 theme.

It only provides essential mobile related functions, it does not support all MyBB 1.8 features.

For more information, please go to: http://flexplat.com/mobile-mybb-18-premium .

Please do NOT use this software when you are driving -- looking at mobile screen while driving is very dangerous.  If you are a webmaster, please forward this caution to your end users.
